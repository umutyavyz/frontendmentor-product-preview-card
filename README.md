# Frontend Mentor - Product Preview Card Component

This is my solution to the [Product Preview Card Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa).  
It was built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal was to create a responsive product card with optimized layout for both mobile and desktop.
